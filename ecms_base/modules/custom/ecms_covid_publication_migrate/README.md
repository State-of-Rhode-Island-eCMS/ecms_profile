# eCMS Covid Publication Migration

The eCMS Covid Publication Migration is specific to the Covid-19 site and will
create publication nodes with external links from an rss feed provided by the
RI Department of Health. The migration will be setup on a cron job to run at
regular intervals to keep the site updated with the latest Covid related publications.
