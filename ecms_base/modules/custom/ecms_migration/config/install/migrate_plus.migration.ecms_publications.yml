  # The feed file for the spreadsheet. The Google Spreadsheet should be either “Public” or set to “Anyone with link can
  # view” in order for the feed to work. Note that the <SHEET> param is the order of the tabs and WILL change if the
  # tabs are re-ordered.
  # Template: 'https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/<KEY>/<SHEET>/public/values?alt=json'

  # Under 'fields', we list the data items to be imported. The first level keys
  # are the source field names we want to populate (the names to be used as
  # sources in the process configuration below). For each field we're importing,
  # we provide a label (optional - this is for display in migration tools) and
  # an selector (xpath) for retrieving that value. It's important to note that this xpath
  # is relative to the elements retrieved by item_selector.
  # For Google Spreadsheet XML feeds the actual columns are named with gsx: followed by the cleaned column name (lower,
  # limited punctuation, etc).

  # Use the URL as the key unique migration identifier.
