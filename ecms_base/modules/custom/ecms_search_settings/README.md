# eCMS Search Settings

This module allows search config settings -- such as the character count of
text in search results -- to be set on a site by site basis.

## Configuration

This module provides a config form at the path `/admin/config/ecms_search_settings/settings`
And these values are saved in a simple config settings file `ecms_search_settings.settings.yml`

You can set two values there:

- Excerpt Length: The length of the excerpt generated by Search API's Highlight processor

Upon form submission, this also updates the `processor_settings.highlight.excerpt_length`
value of `search_api.index.acquia_search_index` config.

- Character Limit: A maximum length imposed by the Twig template `ecms_patternlab/source/_patterns/01-molecules/teaser-article/teaser-article.twig`

When the `acquia_search` view is rendered, it gets the current `character_limit` value
from this module's config, and passes as a variable to twig template using theme hook
`ecms_preprocess_views_view_fields`.
